/*
    THIS GATEWAY CODE IS PROVIDED FOR SAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY.
    THIS CODE IS SPECIALLY DEVELOPED FOR THIS PROJECT ONLY.

    I'm developing a robust gateway module that will enable communication between RPi2
    and Arduino with following arduino capabilities directly from RPi2:
        + pinMode
        + digitalWrite
        + digitalRead
        + analogWrite
        + analogRead
        + Servo Library

    It means you can control and access ADC, PWM and Serial pins resides on Arduino directly from RPi2.

    I have already developed gateway module that is available with project:
    https://www.hackster.io/AnuragVasanwala/windows-10-iot-core-hydroflyer

    But at current stage, the gateway module is in early stage and there are several issues with stability of Arduino.
    Thus, I'm improving module. In advance, I'm going to provide gateway module for Arduino Wiring Sketch and Universal Windows App.

    Stay tuned :)
